## Opdrachten

2. [AJAX pok√©dex](./AJAX-pokedex.md/)
3. [Movie API](./oMDb-API.md)
5. [Beer Displayer](punkapi.com) 

Use the Punk API to make an application that displays beers. For each beer it should display its name, tagline, its year of first brewery and its image.

Each beer should be presented in a rectangle and multiple rectangles should be shown on the same line. The application should be responsive.

Hey, while you're at it you could take a look at Bootstrap which is already included in the exercise theme. Maybe it contains useful tools to help present all that...
